            Hive Keychain Ltd. ("Hive Keychain", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a blockchain development company focused on facilitating adoption and use of the Hive blockchain. Hive Keychain hosts a landing page at hive-keychain.com, that provides information regarding the different Hive Keychain products, as well as sub-domains for Hive Keychain's product offerings (collectively, the "Site"), which includes text, images, links to opensource code hosted on Github, and other materials and third party information.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Hive Keychain provides pieces of software to certain users, including Hive Keychain browser extension (the "Extension" or the "Browser Wallet"). The Browser Wallet enables users to (i) store locally their Hive accounts and private and public keys, protected by a password (ii) link to decentralized applications (referred to as "dApp(s)"); (iii) perform transactions on the Hive blockchain without giving up custody of their keys; (iv) consult their account history.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Hive Keychain also provides a set of mobile Apps for Android and iOS (collectively "the Apps" or "the Mobile Wallet"), that enable users to (i) access the same features as on the Browser Wallet and (ii) access an in-App browser to directly link dApps to their Hive accounts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Hive Keychain often adds additional functionalities to its codebase (collectively known as the "Services").

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            These Terms of Service (these "Terms" or this "Agreement") (i) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Services and (ii) constitute a legally binding agreement between us and you and/or the entity you represent ("you", "your" or "user").

          <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.1 Changes to Terms of Services</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            We may decide to make changes to this Agreement, in which case we will provide notice of those changes by updating the "Last Updated" date above, posting a notice via our blog. Your continued use of the Service will confirm your acceptance of the changes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            It is important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them, because, if you continue to use the Site or Services after we have modified the Terms, you are agreeing to be legally bound, and to abide, by the modified Terms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Site or Services. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Site or Services, at any time and without notice, in our sole and absolute discretion.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.2 Third-Party Services</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            When you use our Site and/or Services, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties. For example, our feed prices come from Coingecko, our Extensions can be obtained by the Chrome Store and Firefox Add-Ons Store, and our Mobile Apps by the Play Store and Apple Store. Your use of those and other third-party services ("Third-Party Services") will be subject to the privacy policies, terms of use and similar policies and terms, and fees of those third party services.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Eligibility</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You may use the Services if you are considered of age in your jurisdiction of residence, or older, and are not forbidden from using the Services under the applicable law. By using the Site or Services and agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>You are of lawful age, and are lawfully able, to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent and warrant that you have legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</li>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Security</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You acknowledge and understand that Hive Keychain Extension or Mobile Apps should not be the primary place of storage of your private keys. Since your keys are only stored locally on the Services, if you forget your password or change to a new device, you won't be able to access your accounts on Hive Keychain. Therefore, your accounts and associated keys should always be stored safely outside of Hive Keychain, offline if possible. All your private keys ("Active","Posting", "Memo") can be recovered using your "Master Key", which is not saved within our Services.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your Master Key. Note that anyone who knows your Master Key or Active Key can access, transfer or spend your cryptocurrency. Anyone with access to your Posting key can perform blogging actions on your behalf. If you lose your Master Key and/or Active Key, you may not be able to access, transfer or spend your cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You acknowledge and agree that Hive Keychain does not store and is not responsible in any way for the security of your Master Key and derived keys and you agree to hold Hive Keychain, its affiliates, representatives, agents and personnel harmless and that no such party shall be liable in any way in the event you lose your keys and cannot access, transfer or spend your cryptocurrency or other digital assets, including but not limited to NFTs and Hive Engine tokens. You bear sole responsibility for any loss of your cryptocurrency due to failure to retain and/or secure your Master Key and/or derived keys.
          </p>
